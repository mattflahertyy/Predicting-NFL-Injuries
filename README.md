Using Python, this machine learning project aimed to predict NFL injuries by combining Kaggle data with personally scraped NFL player 
and injury data. After thorough cleaning and merging, we trained a model to forecast injuries based on weather, age, and position. 
Utilizing Power BI, we visualized the insights through graphs, offering a comprehensive understanding of injury patterns and contributing factors.
